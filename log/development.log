New business creation is essentially a collaborative enterprise where success requires continuous learning and broad-based sharing of innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nBased in Boston, they deploy capital in early-stage companies located in the eastern U.S. and Canada. Today, they have two separate investment teamsâ€”one focused on early stage ventures in IT/Adv.Materials technologies and the other focused on life sciences.\r\n\r\nTo date, VIMAC investments have led to the creation of over 20 successful companies that continue to generate business innovations in IT, communications, and Internet technologies. These investments today account for over $2 billion in market value. The fund seeks to make about five new investments each year. A new investment typically goes into a Series A or Series B round with adequate reserves to support subsequent funding until the company exits via a trade sale or an IPO. Over its lifetime, a company is likely to receive $5 million to $15 million from the fund. The life sciences team makes investments from the VIMAC Milestone Medica in early stage biotechnology and medical device companies.\r\n\r\nThey lead or co-lead most investments and their managers play a very active role on portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors. Often, they invest in a company's first institutional round of funding and maintain support throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle. Along the way, they maintain a close working relationship with the management team, helping them refine business plan, build go-to-market strategies, enhance capital efficiency, find early customers and partners, and grow the business.\r\n"], ["image", "29837v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.358367], ["longitude", -71.052544], ["name", "Vimac Ventures"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:23:39 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2109]]

To become a member, visit www.socialtrak.com\r\n\r\nSocialTrak, (www.socialtrak.com) a new social network and online community for those who want to connect with friends, professionals, and potential customers in their local area, has launched.  SocialTrak is designed specifically to locate, communicate, and network with others in a memberâ€™s geographic area or with people who engage in similar activities, hobbies, casual or cultural pursuits.  Members can create multiple profiles, network for business purposes, search for jobs, post classified ads, upload photo albums, and establish or maintain friendships. \r\n\r\nMembership is completely free. Donations of $.25 cents will be made for each new member that signs up to SocialTrak. New users will be able to choose from 12 different charities. \r\n\r\nJonah Lupton, SocialTrak founder, said, â€œConnecting locally is a more powerful and effective way to network. Thatâ€™s why SocialTrak takes social networking and social media closer to your local area.  SocialTrak offers customized networks based on geography, personal interests, and career fields.  We are launching in New England, a region that offers so much professionally, academically, culturally and socially.  Our goal is to simplify the social networking experience and enable people to make more valuable personal and business connections.â€\u009D \r\n\r\nInitially, SocialTrak will focus on geographic areas around New England including Boston, Cape Cod, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.  The company will expand the service into 25-plus U.S. cities.  SocialTrak also offers a variety of online communities that bring together all kinds of people including entrepreneurs, golfers, estate planners and much more.  Unlike other social networks, members can create as many profiles as they want while still controlling the privacy settings of each profile.   \r\n\r\nSocialTrak strives to become the â€œone stop shopâ€\u009D where members can link and manage other accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Flickr, as well as blogs and RSS feeds.  The company is developing new applications to increase user experience including web conferencing, email marketing and event planning.  \r\n\r\nSmall businesses, professional organizations, and educational institutions that want to set up their own privately branded networks can partner with SocialTrak to customize, host and manage these networks.  \r\n\r\nSocialTrak was originally conceptualized when Mr. Lupton wanted to establish a social intranet in his residential complex. Currently self-funded, SocialTrak plans to begin monetizing site traffic through advertising and business partnerships. \r\n\r\n"], ["image", "47260v2-max-150x150.jpg"], ["latitude", 42.3636955], ["longitude", -71.0644449], ["name", "SocialTrak.com"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:24:21 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2114]]

A new investment typically goes into a Series A or Series B round with adequate reserves to support subsequent funding until the company exits via a trade sale or an IPO. Over its lifetime, a company is likely to receive $5 million to $15 million from the fund. The life sciences team makes investments from the VIMAC Milestone Medica in early stage biotechnology and medical device companies.\r\n\r\nThey lead or co-lead most investments and their managers play a very active role on portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors. Often, they invest in a company's first institutional round of funding and maintain support throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle.

To become a member, visit www.socialtrak.com\r\n\r\nSocialTrak, (www.socialtrak.com) a new social network and online community for those who want to connect with friends, professionals, and potential customers in their local area, has launched.  SocialTrak is designed specifically to locate, communicate, and network with others in a memberâ€™s geographic area or with people who engage in similar activities, hobbies, casual or cultural pursuits.  Members can create multiple profiles, network for business purposes, search for jobs, post classified ads, upload photo albums, and establish or maintain friendships. \r\n\r\nMembership is completely free. Donations of $.25 cents will be made for each new member that signs up to SocialTrak. New users will be able to choose from 12 different charities. \r\n\r\nJonah Lupton, SocialTrak founder, said, â€œConnecting locally is a more powerful and effective way to network. Thatâ€™s why SocialTrak takes social networking and social media closer to your local area.  SocialTrak offers customized networks based on geography, personal interests, and career fields.  We are launching in New England, a region that offers so much professionally, academically, culturally and socially.  Our goal is to simplify the social networking experience and enable people to make more valuable personal and business connections.â€\u009D \r\n\r\nInitially, SocialTrak will focus on geographic areas around New England including Boston, Cape Cod, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.  The company will expand the service into 25-plus U.S. cities.  SocialTrak also offers a variety of online communities that bring together all kinds of people including entrepreneurs, golfers, estate planners and much more.  Unlike other social networks, members can create as many profiles as they want while still controlling the privacy settings of each profile.   \r\n\r\nSocialTrak strives to become the â€œone stop shopâ€\u009D where members can link and manage other accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Flickr, as well as blogs and RSS feeds.  The company is developing new applications to increase user experience including web conferencing, email marketing and event planning.  \r\n\r\nSmall businesses, professional organizations, and educational institutions that want to set up their own privately branded networks can partner with SocialTrak to customize, host and manage these networks.  \r\n\r\nSocialTrak was originally conceptualized when Mr. Lupton wanted to establish a social intranet in his residential complex. Currently self-funded, SocialTrak plans to begin monetizing site traffic through advertising and business partnerships. \r\n\r\n"], ["image", "47260v2-max-150x150.jpg"], ["latitude", 42.3636955], ["longitude", -71.0644449], ["name", "SocialTrak.com"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:33:03 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2114]]

We have seen its potential from the inside, from the boardroom, the lab bench, and the patient bedside. Given economic and demographic trends, there is a rapidly growing market need; there are tremendous advances in biotechnology and materials science. This is a great opportunity for the informed and involved investor. \r\n\r\nHistorically, investing in private life sciences and healthcare equity has produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plans of potential investments. Because of the cyclical nature of the life sciences and healthcare public equity markets, we seek opportunities that build a defensive portfolio with a variety of liquidity options.\r\n\r\nWith the dynamic expansion in medical and life sciences research over the past 30 years, large, multinational pharmaceutical and medical device companies have come to rely on entrepreneurial, research-driven biotechnology and medical device companies to provide them with new products. This continues to drive a strong market for new ideas with demonstrated economic and medical value.\r\n\r\nThe three General Partners have all been CEOs of companies active in the life sciences and healthcare industry, with over 62 years of combined experience and a proven record of identifying and developing promising technologies. As a result, they have extensive networks in the biotechnology industry's scientific, investment, and professional communities that can be leveraged by the firmâ€™s funded entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nWe are active investors, taking board seats in most of our portfolio companies. We led or co-led six of the seven deals closed to date in Fund III.\r\n\r\nBioVentures does not expect portfolio companies to achieve profitability or significant sales during its ownership. Instead, our focus is to finance clearly identified scientific experiments and operational goals, which, if successful, will reduce uncertainty and dramatically raise value. Our primary goal during the ownership period is to perfect the patent portfolio and demonstrate efficacy and utility.\r\n\r\nEastern Massachusetts is a world center for the development of life sciences and healthcare technology. The numerous basic science and clinical research institutions in the area allow the General Partners to remain current in the sciences and to access the opinions of leading researchers for deal evaluation. Furthermore, the Cambridge / Boston community is rich in support services in the firmâ€™s areas of interest, such as patent counsel, law firms, regulatory experts, accountants, bankers and business consultants.\r\n\r\nThe General Partners enjoy excellent, established relationships with the communities critical to building new companies. They have had decades of contact with the scientific, legal, investment and consulting organizations specializing in life sciences and healthcare. In addition, they have established reputations within life sciences and healthcare and bring added value to their investments in the form of management and scientific expertise.\r\n\r\nVenture investing is time-consuming, and demands the active participation of fund Partners. Therefore, BioVenturesâ€™ funds have what the Partners believe is an optimal ratio of capital under management and Partner time allocation. Both the size of the firmâ€™s funds and the firmâ€™s proximity to emerging technology allows the Partners to work closely with portfolio companies, to meet regularly with the managers of new ventures, and to stay current on technology and the financial environment. The entire BioVentures team stays current with all portfolio investments, allowing any of us to step in when special expertise is required.\r\n\r\nHistorically, investing in private life science and healthcare equities has generally produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plan presented by potential investments. BioVentures invests in an assortment of new technologies at varied developmental stages to construct a \"market basket\" of ventures with varied risk profiles and time horizons, seeking multiple exit routes whenever possible. The firmâ€™s preference is to invest in a company at the first institutional round.\r\n\r\nBioVentures currently has over $145 million under management. Investments in individual companies typically range from $3 to $7 million dollars. Fund Partners typically take board seats, or in those transactions in which we do not lead or co-lead, attend all Board meetings as observers. In our current fund, we hold board seats in all of our major investments."], ["image", "55091v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.362162], ["longitude", -71.081788], ["name", "Bioventures Investors"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:35:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2142]]

Android 4.0. Control it with the wave of a hand, using our revolutionary gesture remote. \r\n\r\nEquiso puts the Power of an Android tablet on your TV.  Combined with our interactive remote, Equiso will truly refine your TV experience.\r\n\r\nWatch stunning 1080p HD content from Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube and many more! Send emails, update your facebook status, play Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja like never before. Download new apps, create and display a powerpoint, listen to music, read books, and play most all those interactive games you love so much on your phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nImagine showing up to do a presentation, and all you had to do, was plug it in, grab your remote, and you're ready to go. Game night with your buddies is now easier than ever.  Bring your device with you in your pocket, plug in and play. Our 1.4 HDMI 1080p port allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector. This enables any of these devices to instantly become a Smart TV and eliminates the need for extra cables. \r\n\r\nA Remote like no other\r\n\r\nThis remote is like nothing you have ever experienced before. Advanced accelerometers and gyros sense your gestures, turning them into life like interaction with your Smart TV. Soft touch buttons on top add to your Smart TV experience. Simply flip the remote over and it becomes a full keyboard, no pain staking tasks of typing letter by letter on the screen. Flip it back over and your gesture remote is back in full action to conquer that next level of Angry Birds or Tower Defense. Don't worry about accidentally pressing the buttons on the keyboard. Our gyros sense the remotes position and turn off the keyboard as you glide your way around. This is truly the next step into a Smart TV.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hood\r\n\r\nWe wanted to created a device that was affordable for everyone without sacrificing performance.\r\n\r\nEquiso is equipped with a new, powerful, redesigned 1Ghz Arm Cortex A5 Processor. Using the lastest technology in memory it features 512MB of DDR3 memory that compliments the performance of the system. Graphics was very important as we wanted to include 3D gaming. To achieve this we installed a Mali 400 graphics processor. High Definition Streaming of movies, gaming, and music was a must, so we added a Wireless N radio that is capable of speeds up 250 megabits, to ensure blazing fast downloads. Our 1.4 HDMI plug n play interface allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector and supports 3D Video. Included is 8GB of internal storage for storing music, movies, documents, games and more. We put a USB port on the back for a keyboard, a mouse, external hard drives and anything else you can plug in. Heat was a major concern for a form factor this small. For this reason we chose the most energy efficient Arm CPU per watt. We worked tirelessly on a case that would disperse the heat but handle the dust. Equiso is very quiet as there are no moving parts. We truly hope your enjoy our product.\r\n"], ["image", "214921v2-max-150x150.jpg"], ["latitude", 42.3628171], ["longitude", -71.0840199], ["name", "EQUISO"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:35:48 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2142]]

After an operational procedure has been dissected and analyzed, industry-standard â€œBest Practicesâ€\u009D content, efficiencies, and controls are implemented.

Dr. Saluti personally conducts procedural-level workflow analysis.  Marjorie Cahn personally reviews, tests, and edits completed Word document procedures.  This ensures superior-quality output.  Also, FTE cost savings realized from Saluti Cahn efficiencies provides immediate ROI.

By combining the real-time power of the Internet with a geographic clustering engine, Mix technology facilitates spontaneous, same-day, meetings between unacquainted people sharing a common interest, and does so without any user-to-user interaction.  \r\n\r\nMix clusters individuals into small groups and then geographically optimizes the mixer venue selection to minimize users' travel distance. Reservations are received throughout the day, the clustering engine is run at 4 PM, and then users are provided with their mixer assignments telling them where to go and who they will meet at the specified time.  The user simply makes an online reservation and Mix does the rest.  Upon arrival at the mixer users can locate each other with any of three methods: visual identification, physical table markers, and electronic message delivery.  Typical venues would include bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and other commercial/public locations. For maximum convenience, users can make reservations, receive confirmations, and perform mixer check-in via cell phone.   \r\n\r\nMix is free to join and there are no membership or annual subscription fees. Mix has a pay-as-you-go fee based business model with a per use charge (similar to a cover charge) for its products that deliver value by simplifying users' social lives and introducing them to new people through \"Instant Mixers.\" However, to balance the site appeal, it also has a large free component, as \"Friends Mixers\" give users a quick and easy way to coordinate real-time get-togethers with their existing friends.   \r\n\r\nThe Mix venture is comprised of 4 business platforms (Singles, Common Interest, Business Networking, and Political Action) plus a technology licensing strategy. Each of the platforms will employ the same patent pending technology in a different context. Mix will launch with its first of four platforms \"Singles\" as MixBoston.com, followed with a national rollout in other major cities, and then proceed to implement its other platforms.  \r\n\r\nMix has a two-pronged licensing strategy, the first of which is to license its Business Networking platform in its entirety and give away its Political Action platform to the national political parties as a community service. However, since Mix can add real world interaction and revenue to any website with a virtual community, Mix also plans to provide its technology under shared net revenue agreements to topic or demographic specific websites with virtual communities. For example, Mix has initiated discussions with Eons.com to license its technology in a common interest application for the 50+ crowd. Other ideal license partners would include websites such as iVillage, ClubMom, and Major League Baseball since they have narrowly focused virtual communities that would not cannibalize Mix's core platforms."], ["image", "664v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.368143], ["longitude", -71.113518], ["name", "Mix & Meet"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:36:56 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2139]]

The fund made 15 investments and is fully invested or committed. These investments ranged in size from $750,000 to $5 million.\r\n\r\nEgan-Managed Capital II has $100 million of capital and was formed in 2000.

These include Registration Rights, Voting Agreements, etc. Since providing assistance to their portfolio companies is such an important part of their investment philosophy, they nearly always require a board seat.

These investments today account for over $2 billion in market value. The fund seeks to make about five new investments each year. A new investment typically goes into a Series A or Series B round with adequate reserves to support subsequent funding until the company exits via a trade sale or an IPO. Over its lifetime, a company is likely to receive $5 million to $15 million from the fund. The life sciences team makes investments from the VIMAC Milestone Medica in early stage biotechnology and medical device companies.\r\n\r\nThey lead or co-lead most investments and their managers play a very active role on portfolio companiesâ€™ Boards of Directors. Often, they invest in a company's first institutional round of funding and maintain support throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle. Along the way, they maintain a close working relationship with the management team, helping them refine business plan, build go-to-market strategies, enhance capital efficiency, find early customers and partners, and grow the business.\r\n"], ["image", "29837v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.358367], ["longitude", -71.052544], ["name", "Vimac Ventures"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:40:10 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2109]]

SocialTrak is designed specifically to locate, communicate, and network with others in a memberâ€™s geographic area or with people who engage in similar activities, hobbies, casual or cultural pursuits.  Members can create multiple profiles, network for business purposes, search for jobs, post classified ads, upload photo albums, and establish or maintain friendships. \r\n\r\nMembership is completely free. Donations of $.25 cents will be made for each new member that signs up to SocialTrak. New users will be able to choose from 12 different charities. \r\n\r\nJonah Lupton, SocialTrak founder, said, â€œConnecting locally is a more powerful and effective way to network. Thatâ€™s why SocialTrak takes social networking and social media closer to your local area.  SocialTrak offers customized networks based on geography, personal interests, and career fields.  We are launching in New England, a region that offers so much professionally, academically, culturally and socially.  Our goal is to simplify the social networking experience and enable people to make more valuable personal and business connections.â€\u009D \r\n\r\nInitially, SocialTrak will focus on geographic areas around New England including Boston, Cape Cod, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.  The company will expand the service into 25-plus U.S. cities.  SocialTrak also offers a variety of online communities that bring together all kinds of people including entrepreneurs, golfers, estate planners and much more.  Unlike other social networks, members can create as many profiles as they want while still controlling the privacy settings of each profile.   \r\n\r\nSocialTrak strives to become the â€œone stop shopâ€\u009D where members can link and manage other accounts, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Flickr, as well as blogs and RSS feeds.  The company is developing new applications to increase user experience including web conferencing, email marketing and event planning.  \r\n\r\nSmall businesses, professional organizations, and educational institutions that want to set up their own privately branded networks can partner with SocialTrak to customize, host and manage these networks.  \r\n\r\nSocialTrak was originally conceptualized when Mr. Lupton wanted to establish a social intranet in his residential complex.

We have seen its potential from the inside, from the boardroom, the lab bench, and the patient bedside. Given economic and demographic trends, there is a rapidly growing market need; there are tremendous advances in biotechnology and materials science. This is a great opportunity for the informed and involved investor. \r\n\r\nHistorically, investing in private life sciences and healthcare equity has produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plans of potential investments. Because of the cyclical nature of the life sciences and healthcare public equity markets, we seek opportunities that build a defensive portfolio with a variety of liquidity options.\r\n\r\nWith the dynamic expansion in medical and life sciences research over the past 30 years, large, multinational pharmaceutical and medical device companies have come to rely on entrepreneurial, research-driven biotechnology and medical device companies to provide them with new products. This continues to drive a strong market for new ideas with demonstrated economic and medical value.\r\n\r\nThe three General Partners have all been CEOs of companies active in the life sciences and healthcare industry, with over 62 years of combined experience and a proven record of identifying and developing promising technologies. As a result, they have extensive networks in the biotechnology industry's scientific, investment, and professional communities that can be leveraged by the firmâ€™s funded entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nWe are active investors, taking board seats in most of our portfolio companies. We led or co-led six of the seven deals closed to date in Fund III.\r\n\r\nBioVentures does not expect portfolio companies to achieve profitability or significant sales during its ownership. Instead, our focus is to finance clearly identified scientific experiments and operational goals, which, if successful, will reduce uncertainty and dramatically raise value. Our primary goal during the ownership period is to perfect the patent portfolio and demonstrate efficacy and utility.\r\n\r\nEastern Massachusetts is a world center for the development of life sciences and healthcare technology. The numerous basic science and clinical research institutions in the area allow the General Partners to remain current in the sciences and to access the opinions of leading researchers for deal evaluation. Furthermore, the Cambridge / Boston community is rich in support services in the firmâ€™s areas of interest, such as patent counsel, law firms, regulatory experts, accountants, bankers and business consultants.\r\n\r\nThe General Partners enjoy excellent, established relationships with the communities critical to building new companies. They have had decades of contact with the scientific, legal, investment and consulting organizations specializing in life sciences and healthcare. In addition, they have established reputations within life sciences and healthcare and bring added value to their investments in the form of management and scientific expertise.\r\n\r\nVenture investing is time-consuming, and demands the active participation of fund Partners. Therefore, BioVenturesâ€™ funds have what the Partners believe is an optimal ratio of capital under management and Partner time allocation. Both the size of the firmâ€™s funds and the firmâ€™s proximity to emerging technology allows the Partners to work closely with portfolio companies, to meet regularly with the managers of new ventures, and to stay current on technology and the financial environment. The entire BioVentures team stays current with all portfolio investments, allowing any of us to step in when special expertise is required.\r\n\r\nHistorically, investing in private life science and healthcare equities has generally produced excellent returns for investors able to appropriately value both the technology and the strategic plan presented by potential investments. BioVentures invests in an assortment of new technologies at varied developmental stages to construct a \"market basket\" of ventures with varied risk profiles and time horizons, seeking multiple exit routes whenever possible. The firmâ€™s preference is to invest in a company at the first institutional round.\r\n\r\nBioVentures currently has over $145 million under management. Investments in individual companies typically range from $3 to $7 million dollars. Fund Partners typically take board seats, or in those transactions in which we do not lead or co-lead, attend all Board meetings as observers. In our current fund, we hold board seats in all of our major investments."], ["image", "55091v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.362162], ["longitude", -71.081788], ["name", "Bioventures Investors"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:41:21 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2142]]

Send emails, update your facebook status, play Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja like never before. Download new apps, create and display a powerpoint, listen to music, read books, and play most all those interactive games you love so much on your phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nImagine showing up to do a presentation, and all you had to do, was plug it in, grab your remote, and you're ready to go. Game night with your buddies is now easier than ever.  Bring your device with you in your pocket, plug in and play. Our 1.4 HDMI 1080p port allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector. This enables any of these devices to instantly become a Smart TV and eliminates the need for extra cables. \r\n\r\nA Remote like no other\r\n\r\nThis remote is like nothing you have ever experienced before. Advanced accelerometers and gyros sense your gestures, turning them into life like interaction with your Smart TV. Soft touch buttons on top add to your Smart TV experience. Simply flip the remote over and it becomes a full keyboard, no pain staking tasks of typing letter by letter on the screen. Flip it back over and your gesture remote is back in full action to conquer that next level of Angry Birds or Tower Defense. Don't worry about accidentally pressing the buttons on the keyboard. Our gyros sense the remotes position and turn off the keyboard as you glide your way around. This is truly the next step into a Smart TV.\r\n\r\nUnder the Hood\r\n\r\nWe wanted to created a device that was affordable for everyone without sacrificing performance.\r\n\r\nEquiso is equipped with a new, powerful, redesigned 1Ghz Arm Cortex A5 Processor. Using the lastest technology in memory it features 512MB of DDR3 memory that compliments the performance of the system. Graphics was very important as we wanted to include 3D gaming. To achieve this we installed a Mali 400 graphics processor. High Definition Streaming of movies, gaming, and music was a must, so we added a Wireless N radio that is capable of speeds up 250 megabits, to ensure blazing fast downloads. Our 1.4 HDMI plug n play interface allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector and supports 3D Video. Included is 8GB of internal storage for storing music, movies, documents, games and more. We put a USB port on the back for a keyboard, a mouse, external hard drives and anything else you can plug in. Heat was a major concern for a form factor this small. For this reason we chose the most energy efficient Arm CPU per watt. We worked tirelessly on a case that would disperse the heat but handle the dust. Equiso is very quiet as there are no moving parts. We truly hope your enjoy our product.\r\n"], ["image", "214921v2-max-150x150.jpg"], ["latitude", 42.3628171], ["longitude", -71.0840199], ["name", "EQUISO"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:42:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2142]]

After an operational procedure has been dissected and analyzed, industry-standard â€œBest Practicesâ€\u009D content, efficiencies, and controls are implemented.  Then, Saluti Cahn can produce hyperlinked Word document procedures as an end product.  These updated, documented procedures are then used for staff re-training and reference. \r\n\r\nAdvantages of Using Saluti Cahn\r\nSaluti Cahn strategically limits the number of projects accepted, enabling the principals, Dr. Dean Saluti and Marjorie Cahn, to be at the Client sites working with their staff at all times.  Dr. Saluti personally conducts procedural-level workflow analysis.  Marjorie Cahn personally reviews, tests, and edits completed Word document procedures.  This ensures superior-quality output.  Also, FTE cost savings realized from Saluti Cahn efficiencies provides immediate ROI.  Saluti Cahnâ€™s reasonable billing for an entire project is, in most cases, completely paid from ROI realized within the first month of project assignment.\r\n\r\nExamples of Retirement Operational Efficiencies Projects:\r\n\r\n2008 to 2009: Vanguard Retirement Services (www.RetirementPlans.Vanguard.com) \r\nâ€“ After only five months, Saluti Cahn identified significant operational efficiencies, resulting in 90 potential FTE cost savings â€“ approximately $4.5M.

By combining the real-time power of the Internet with a geographic clustering engine, Mix technology facilitates spontaneous, same-day, meetings between unacquainted people sharing a common interest, and does so without any user-to-user interaction.  \r\n\r\nMix clusters individuals into small groups and then geographically optimizes the mixer venue selection to minimize users' travel distance. Reservations are received throughout the day, the clustering engine is run at 4 PM, and then users are provided with their mixer assignments telling them where to go and who they will meet at the specified time.  The user simply makes an online reservation and Mix does the rest.  Upon arrival at the mixer users can locate each other with any of three methods: visual identification, physical table markers, and electronic message delivery.  Typical venues would include bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and other commercial/public locations. For maximum convenience, users can make reservations, receive confirmations, and perform mixer check-in via cell phone.   \r\n\r\nMix is free to join and there are no membership or annual subscription fees. Mix has a pay-as-you-go fee based business model with a per use charge (similar to a cover charge) for its products that deliver value by simplifying users' social lives and introducing them to new people through \"Instant Mixers.\" However, to balance the site appeal, it also has a large free component, as \"Friends Mixers\" give users a quick and easy way to coordinate real-time get-togethers with their existing friends.   \r\n\r\nThe Mix venture is comprised of 4 business platforms (Singles, Common Interest, Business Networking, and Political Action) plus a technology licensing strategy. Each of the platforms will employ the same patent pending technology in a different context. Mix will launch with its first of four platforms \"Singles\" as MixBoston.com, followed with a national rollout in other major cities, and then proceed to implement its other platforms.  \r\n\r\nMix has a two-pronged licensing strategy, the first of which is to license its Business Networking platform in its entirety and give away its Political Action platform to the national political parties as a community service. However, since Mix can add real world interaction and revenue to any website with a virtual community, Mix also plans to provide its technology under shared net revenue agreements to topic or demographic specific websites with virtual communities. For example, Mix has initiated discussions with Eons.com to license its technology in a common interest application for the 50+ crowd. Other ideal license partners would include websites such as iVillage, ClubMom, and Major League Baseball since they have narrowly focused virtual communities that would not cannibalize Mix's core platforms."], ["image", "664v1-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.368143], ["longitude", -71.113518], ["name", "Mix & Meet"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:42:55 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2139]]

The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. \r\n\r\nProf. SoljaÄ\u008DiÄ‡'s team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This â€œstrong couplingâ€\u009D enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  \r\n\r\n Prof. SoljaÄ\u008DiÄ‡ was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship (also known as â€œGenius Grantâ€\u009D) in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T.

They are committed to attracting and retaining the very best legal talent available. Their commitment to recruiting and developing extraordinary legal talent is borne out by the firmâ€™s consistent top-ten rankings in The American Lawyerâ€™s annual Summer Associate Survey.\r\n\r\nThe firmâ€™s structure and internal systems, including the firmâ€™s partner compensation system, have been intentionally designed to enable us to work together in extremely focused and effective client and transactional teams.

Structured like HTML, FluidHtml allows any web developer to dynamically generate Rich Media sites and applications and is compatible with all major browsers.  FluidHtml solves the Flashâ„¢ search problem by exposing the markup text to search engines.  Now web publishers can combine the human appeal of rich media with all the business benefits of the web.\r\n\r\nFluidHtml has several additional important benefits.   It runs in Flash, which is ubiquitous and which is consistent across all browsers.   FluidHtml integrates seamlessly with server-side web technologies such as Java, .NET and PHP.   And it includes a liquid layout engine with significantly more flexibility than CSS.\r\n\r\nFluidHtml is free to developers and we provide an open API to allow the community to extend the language.   When a site or application is ready to go to production, we charge publishers a low annual fee for use of the language.  The language is ready for use and we are presently in the final stages of delivery with initial customers, to be announced shortly.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about FluidHtml, please visit www.fluidhtml.com.   \r\n"], ["image", "59502v2-max-150x150.png"], ["latitude", 42.407666], ["longitude", -71.277012], ["name", "Fluid HTML"], ["updated_at", Wed, 13 Mar 2013 03:45:40 UTC +00:00], ["url", nil], ["zip", 2451]]
